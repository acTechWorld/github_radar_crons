Pinia has almost the exact same or enhanced API as Vuex 5, described in Vuex 5 RFC. You could simply consider Pinia as Vuex 5 with a different name. Pinia also works with Vue 2.x as well. Vuex 3 and 4 will still be maintained. However, it's unlikely to add new functionalities to it. Vuex and Pinia can be installed in the same project. If you're migrating existing Vuex app to Pinia, it might be a suitable option. However, if you're planning to start a new project, we highly recommend using Pinia instead. --- Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It also integrates with Vue's official devtools extension to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import. Learn more about Vuex at 'What is Vuex', or get started by looking into full documentation. ## Documentation To check out docs, visit vuex.vuejs.org. ## Examples You may find example applications built with Vuex under the examples directory.

        "readme": "Redux is a JS library for predictable and maintainable global state management. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger. You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. The Redux core is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons. Redux Toolkit is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications. Installation: The recommended way to start new apps with React and Redux Toolkit is by using our official Redux Toolkit + TS template for Vite, or by creating a new Next.js project using Next's with-redux template. Both of these already have Redux Toolkit and React-Redux configured appropriately for that build tool, and come with a small example app that demonstrates how to use several of Redux Toolkit's features. We do not currently have official React Native templates, but recommend these templates for standard React Native and for Expo: https://github.com/rahsheen/react-native-template-redux-typescript https://github.com/rahsheen/expo-template-redux-typescript npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux For the Redux core library by itself: npm install redux For more details, see the Installation docs page. Documentation: The Redux core docs are located at https://redux.js.org, and include the full Redux tutorials, as well usage guides on general Redux patterns: Introduction, Tutorials, Usage Guides, FAQ, API Reference. The Redux Toolkit docs are available at https://redux-toolkit.js.org, including API references and usage guides for all of the APIs included in Redux Toolkit. Learn Redux: Redux Essentials Tutorial The Redux Essentials tutorial is a 'top-down' tutorial that teaches 'how to use Redux the right way', using our latest recommended APIs and best practices. We recommend starting there. Redux Fundamentals Tutorial The Redux Fundamentals tutorial is a 'bottom-up' tutorial that teaches 'how Redux works' from first principles and without any abstractions, and why standard Redux usage patterns exist. Help and Discussion: The #redux channel of the Reactiflux Discord community is our official resource for all questions related to learning and using Redux. Reactiflux is a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn - please come and join us there! Before Proceeding Further: Redux is a valuable tool for organizing your state, but you should also consider whether it's appropriate for your situation. Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it. Here are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux: You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time You need a single source of truth for your state You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient Yes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application. For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see: When (and when not) to reach for Redux You Might Not Need Redux The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy Redux FAQ Basic Example: The whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store. The only way to change the state tree is to create an action, an object describing what happened, and dispatch it to the store. To specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure reducer functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action. Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, the basic app logic looks like: import { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit' const counterSlice = createSlice({ name: 'counter', initialState: { value: 0 }, reducers: { incremented: state => { state.value += 1 }, decremented: state => { state.value -= 1 } } }) export const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterSlice.reducer }) store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState())) store.dispatch(incremented()) store.dispatch(incremented()) store.dispatch(decremented()) Redux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the original core Redux behavior and data flow.
