**WHAT YOU SHOULD DO**  
You will process a list of 100 GitHub repositories in JSON format and extract only the repository names.

### INPUT FORMAT:
- Each entry in the list is a JSON object with this structure:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "[REPOSITORY_NAME]",
    "description": "[REPOSITORY_DESCRIPTION]"
  }
  ```

### TASK:
- Extract only the `name` field from each JSON object.
- Ensure the output contains exactly 100 names (one per repository).
- Give me the result yourself and don’t create a script to do it.

### OUTPUT FORMAT:
- The output should contain 100 lines, one per repository.
- Each line should be numbered sequentially from 1 to 100.
- The response should be in English only.

### EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
1. x  
2. shadcn-vue  
3. [REPOSITORY_NAME 3]  
...  
100. [REPOSITORY_NAME 100]
